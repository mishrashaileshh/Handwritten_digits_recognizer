Handwritten digits recognition

# Objective:
To develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) with high accuracy, using the MNIST dataset.

# Dataset:

# MNIST Dataset: 
60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each image being 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

# Model Architecture:

# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
Input Layer: 28x28x1 grayscale images.
Convolutional Layers: Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation and varying kernel sizes to detect features.
Pooling Layers: MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions and computational complexity.
Fully Connected Layers: Dense layers to learn complex patterns and relationships.
Output Layer: Softmax activation function to classify the images into 10 categories (digits 0-9).

# Implementation Steps:

# Data Preprocessing:

Normalization of pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Reshaping the data to fit the input dimensions of the CNN.
One-hot encoding of target labels.

# Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
Define the CNN architecture using Keras/TensorFlow.
Compile the model with a loss function (categorical cross-entropy), optimizer (Adam), and evaluation metric (accuracy).
Train the model using the training data with appropriate batch size and epochs.

# Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model on the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters.
Test the final model on the test dataset to measure performance.
Achieved over 99% accuracy on the test set.

# Model Deployment:

Save the trained model for future use.
Develop a simple user interface to allow users to draw digits and get predictions in real-time.

# Results:

The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 99.2% on the test dataset.
Demonstrated robustness in recognizing digits under various conditions and handwriting styles.

# Conclusion:

The project successfully developed a high-accuracy digit recognizer using deep learning techniques.
The model can be applied to various real-world applications, such as automated data entry and digit-based authentication systems.
